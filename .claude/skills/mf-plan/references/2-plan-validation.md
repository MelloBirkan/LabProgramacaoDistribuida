# 2 plan-validation

> Converted from a former Claude Code command. Apply the question-tool and tool-equivalence rules from the parent SKILL.md; keep Claude `AskUserQuestion` support and use Codex `request_user_input` when available.

## Role

Reviewer who pressure-tests plans before they become locked in — evaluating both product decisions and technical architecture as appropriate.

**Focus on:**

- The critical 30% — the decisions that shape 80-90% of implementation
- Stress-testing over checkbox — ask "what breaks?" not "is this documented?"
- Codebase grounding — architecture must fit what actually exists
- Simplicity bias — complexity needs justification; simplicity is default
- Finding gaps together and fixing them through collaboration

## Core Philosophy

Plan validation is about stress-testing critical decisions before they become expensive to change.

The Plan captures the defining choices — product-level, technical, or both. This validation ensures those choices are:

- Robust enough to handle failure
- Simple enough to implement and maintain
- Flexible enough to adapt to change
- Grounded in the actual codebase
- Coherent across product and technical dimensions

Value system:

- Flaws found during implementation are 10x more expensive to fix
- Not every detail needs upfront planning — focus on what matters
- Details emerge during implementation; over-planning creates rigidity
- Multiple rounds of clarification and refinement is normal and encouraged

## Validation Focus Areas

Evaluate the Plan against these dimensions. Apply whichever are relevant to the plan's content.

### 1. Problem & Scope Fit

*When the plan includes Problem & Context or User Experience sections:*

- Is the problem clearly articulated and the scope appropriate?
- Do user flows cover the critical paths? Are edge cases considered?
- Are there gaps between what's described and what users would actually need?
- Is the user experience coherent end-to-end?

### 2. Simplicity

- Is the approach as simple as it can be for what it needs to do?
- Are there components or abstractions that could be eliminated?
- Is complexity justified, or is it speculative future-proofing?
- Could a simpler approach achieve the same goals?

### 3. Flexibility

- What happens if requirements change in likely ways?
- Are there hard-coded assumptions that would force major rework?
- Can components be modified independently?
- Is the design adaptable without being over-engineered?

### 4. Robustness & Reliability

- What happens when each major component fails?
- Are failure modes identified and handled?
- Are edge cases considered?
- Is error handling strategy clear for critical paths?

### 5. Scaling Considerations

- Where are the potential bottlenecks?
- What breaks under increased load?
- Are there single points of failure?
- Is the scaling approach proportionate to actual needs (not hypothetical)?

### 6. Codebase Fit

- Does this approach work with existing patterns in the codebase?
- Are we working with the codebase or fighting it?
- Is the integration approach realistic?
- Are proposed patterns consistent with what's already there?

### 7. Cross-Dimensional Consistency

*When the plan covers both product and technical aspects:*

- Does the technical approach fully support the described user experience?
- Are there product decisions that the architecture can't deliver?
- Are there technical decisions that conflict with the intended user experience?
- Do data models support the user flows described?

## Tools

- Use Claude Code `AskUserQuestion` or Codex `request_user_input` when available for all interview and clarification questions. In Claude, present 2-4 distinct options per question ("Other" is added automatically) and ask up to 4 questions per round. In Codex, follow the parent SKILL.md limits.
- Use `Glob`, `Grep`, and `Read` tools to verify codebase patterns and ground validation in the actual code.
- When stress-testing decisions, use MCP tools to verify assumptions against official docs and known constraints: `ref_search_documentation` / `ref_read_url` for library and API docs, `web_search_exa` or `tavily_search` for researching known issues, scaling limits, or best practices.

## Artifacts

All artifacts live in `.mf/<epic-folder>/`. Scan `.mf/` to find the epic folder. If multiple exist, use Claude `AskUserQuestion` or Codex `request_user_input` when available to ask which one to work on. Read and update `.mf/<epic-folder>/plan.md`.

## Processing User Request

1. **Gather Context**

Read and internalize the relevant artifacts:

    - Plan (the approach being validated — product context, user experience, technical architecture)
    - Existing codebase patterns (the reality we're building in)
1. **Baseline Coverage Check**

Before deep analysis, verify the Plan addresses foundational areas relevant to this work.

Evaluate each area qualitatively — not "is this documented?" but "is this adequately addressed?"

**Requirements Coverage**

    - Do core requirements have corresponding approaches (product or technical)?
    - Have critical edge cases and failure scenarios been acknowledged?
    - Have required external integrations been identified with clear approaches?

    **Architecture Completeness** (when technical approach is included)

    - Are major components and their responsibilities clear?
    - Are component interactions and dependencies understood?
    - Is data flow between components defined?
    - Are boundaries between layers established (where applicable)?

    **User Experience Completeness** (when user experience is included)

    - Are primary user flows documented with clear entry and exit points?
    - Are decision points and branches in flows identified?
    - Are error scenarios and recovery approaches outlined?
1. **Identify Critical Decisions**

Extract the defining choices from the Plan:

    - What are the 3-7 decisions that will shape most of the implementation?
    - These are the decisions worth stress-testing
    - Skip trivial or obvious choices

    Look for decisions that:

    - Cross component boundaries (integration points)
    - Handle failure modes or error scenarios
    - Define core data schemas or models
    - Break from or extend existing codebase patterns
    - Have significant performance or scaling implications
    - Affect security boundaries
    - Shape user-facing behavior in non-obvious ways

    Also include any items flagged as "Concern" from the baseline coverage check.

1. **Stress-Test Each Critical Decision**

For each critical decision, evaluate against the relevant focus areas:

    - Does this hold up under failure scenarios?
    - Could this be simpler?
    - What happens if requirements change?
    - Does this fit the existing codebase?
    - Does the technical approach support the product intent (and vice versa)?

    Think through scenarios:

    - Trace a request through the proposed approach end-to-end
    - Inject failures at key points — what breaks, what recovers?
    - Change a requirement — what ripples through the design?

    **Issue Classification Guidance**

    When evaluating, categorize issues by importance to guide clarification priority:

    *Most Important* - Address first:

    - Will cause major rework if not addressed
    - Violates requirements
    - Fundamental robustness gap (no recovery from failures)
    - Security vulnerabilities
    - Product-technical misalignment (architecture can't deliver the intended experience)

    *Significant* - Address before proceeding:

    - Significant complexity that could be simplified
    - Fights existing codebase patterns
    - Notable resilience gaps
    - Missing error handling for critical paths
    - User experience gaps in critical flows

    *Moderate* - Clarify and decide:

    - Minor consistency issues
    - Opportunities for simplification
    - Edge cases to consider
    - Terminology or naming concerns

    *Minor* - Note for awareness:

    - Observations and suggestions
    - Implementation phase considerations
    - Polish and refinements
1. **Interview for Resolution**

Present findings to the user as interview questions. Include detailed description of the issues for better understanding in the question statement itself. For each gap or concern:

    - Explain the issue and why it matters
    - Ask focused questions to understand the reasoning or fill the gap
    - Clarify and resolve before moving to the next issue

    Start with the most important issues first — things that would cause major rework or block implementation. Then work toward smaller observations.

    Multiple rounds of clarification is normal and encouraged. The goal is shared understanding of the plan's strengths and gaps.

1. **Update Plan Based on Clarification**

As issues are resolved through clarification:

    - Update the Plan with clarifications or changes
    - Document any accepted trade-offs
    - Keep changes targeted — don't rewrite unnecessarily
1. **Confirm Readiness**

Once issues are addressed:

    - Review the updated Plan with the user
    - Confirm the changes capture the agreed approach
    - Iterate if any new gaps emerge

## Next Step

Suggest the user proceed with `$mf-plan 3-ticket-breakdown` to break the plan into implementation tickets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Baseline coverage check completed with no unaddressed gaps
- Critical decisions have been identified and stress-tested
- Gaps and concerns have been clarified and resolved
- Agreed-upon changes have been made to the Plan
- Plan is confirmed ready for ticket breakdown
